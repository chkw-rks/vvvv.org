We’re excited to invite the **vvvv community** to the first **BRDGE Club Meetup** – which could become the start of a series!
While the vvvv community usually shares knowledge on **libraries, patches, and code-level challenges**, BRDGE adds a layer on top: it’s about how we turn those technical foundations into **scalable activities, workflows, and real-world projects with clients and design agencies**.

## Agenda Highlights

- What BRDGE is & who could join
- Circular UX Journeys
- Sharing modules & tools
- Collaboration workflows with design- & tech-partner

## We will introduce and share directly to interested partners:

- A very useful **Journey API**
- **Backend for spatial Guides & Trails** made with Ruby on Rails
- A new VVVV **state machine library** which helps us sell better

Join us to learn, exchange, and explore how we can **bridge code, design, and scalable experiences together**.
