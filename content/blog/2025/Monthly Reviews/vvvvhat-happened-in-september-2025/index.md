So..

..we had another [worldwide meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2poVrxXFpA) this month where a bunch of you once again shared interesting insights into your vvvvorks. And you can already save the date for the next one: [31st vvvvorldwide meetup on November 20](https://thenodeinstitute.org/event/31st-vvvv-worldwide-meetup/).

Then, initiated by [-naut](https://vvvv.org/business/naut-gmbh) the first [Bridge Club Meeting](https://brd.ge/firstmeet) has happened to connect [vvvv businesses](https://vvvv.org/business/).

We had a few slow weeks, given the holiday season, with only one small new feature released: [Support for PosiStageNet](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/introducing-support-for-posistagenet/). But we're back in full-swing now and looking forward to exciting new developments ahead...
