Sorry for the late delivery of the revvvview this month. You know...circumstances...

So here goes, the main thing:

![](header-7.png)

**[vvvv gamma 7.0 is out](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/vvvv-gamma-7.0-release/)**. And it is big. Please take a moment to go through the release post if you haven't yet and give it a spin. Any reason not to lovvvve it? Please let us know!

Then save the date for the upcoming [30th vvvv worldwide meetup](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/30.-vvvv-worldwide-meetup/) on September 18th!

And in case you missed it, you can rewatch the [special edition meetup at Ars Electronica](https://www.youtube.com/live/gTfWE8Jsh9Q?si=rW6TDZNaVrzgVJSA).
