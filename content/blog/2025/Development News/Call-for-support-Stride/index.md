Dear shaderers!

Here is a big one: As ya'll know, vvvv's 3d rendering engine is sitting on top of the opensource [Stride3d engine](https://www.stride3d.net/).

What you probably don't know, is what's currently going on over there: 

ðŸ’¥ **[Shader System Rewrite](https://opencollective.com/stride3d/projects/shader-system-rewrite)** ðŸ’¥

And why is this so big then? Well, the biggest thing really is that this is not just a plan anymore, but [development is actively ongoing](https://github.com/stride3d/SDSL) since a while already. It was started by [Youness Kafia](https://github.com/ykafia), a long-term contributer to the project, who has recently been joined by [xen2](http://github.com/xen2) who used to be the main developer of Stride for many years, before it went opensource. So this is serious business. 

### What this means for vvvv

In practical terms, here is what this means for vvvv, once completed:

âœ… Faster shader compilation  
âœ… Less memory footprint  
âœ… Support for Shader Model 6 (raytracing, mesh shaders), pending a switch to DX12

### When can we expect results? 
To clarify: This is a huge effort and it will most likely take longer than anticipated, to be finally really benefitial for vvvv. But initial estimates we heard was 6 months. So let's say mid next year we should hopefully get an update to see where this is at.

Now here is our ask: If you're working with vvvv/Stride/[Fuse](https://www.thefuselab.io/), you'll benefit from these developments one day. So please, if you can 

ðŸ‘‰ **[add your support to the Stride OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/stride3d/projects/shader-system-rewrite/donate)** ðŸ‘ˆ

Yes it takes a moment to sign-up and costs real money, but the real value to the developers will be to see your interest in this happening. So don't worry too much about the how-much, the gesture alone is already quite worthy.

Thanks for your consideration!
